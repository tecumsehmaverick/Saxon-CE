/**
* MappingIterator merges a sequence of sequences into a single flat
* sequence. It takes as inputs an iteration, and a mapping function to be
* applied to each Item returned by that iteration. The mapping function itself
* returns another iteration. The result is an iteration of the concatenation of all
* the iterations returned by the mapping function.<p>
*
* This is a powerful class. It is used, with different mapping functions,
* in a great variety of ways. It underpins the way that "for" expressions and
* path expressions are evaluated, as well as sequence expressions. It is also
* used in the implementation of the document(), key(), and id() functions.
